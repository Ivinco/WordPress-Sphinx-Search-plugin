Search results are more relevant and you can search in posts, pages and comments using flexible search syntax, quickly sort the results by freshness or relevance. This plugin comes with sidebar widgets to display the most recent searches and top and related search terms.

 * Use extended search form to fine tune the results
 * Use sidebar widget for displaying Related/Top search terms

Flexible search syntax

Sphinx allows you to use the following special operators in searchbox:

   1. Operator OR: hello | world
   2. Operator NOT: hello -world, hello !world
   3. Field search operator: @title hello @body worldThe following field operators are available:
      @title – search in title of post or page
      @body – search in body of post, page or comment
      @category – search in blog categories
   4. Phrase search operator: “hello world”
   5. Proximity search operator: “hello world”~10

Here’s an example query which uses all these operators:

"hello world" @title "example program"~5 @body python -(php|perl)

= Semi live update - "main+delta" scheme =

To enable semi-live index updates also known as "main+delta" scheme, 
the plugin will create the following table in your MySQL database:
# in MySQL
CREATE TABLE wp_sph_counter
(
    counter_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    max_doc_id INTEGER NOT NULL
);

If your WordPress installation's table prefix is not "wp_", substitute
the correct value.

= Top and last search terms =
In order to be able to store search statistics the plugin will run 
the following SQL query during the activation process:
# in MySQL
CREATE TABLE `wp_sph_stats` (
	`id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
	`keywords` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
	`date_added` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
	`keywords_full` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
	PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	KEY `keywords` (`keywords`)
);

If your WordPress installation's table prefix is not "wp_", substitute
the correct value.
